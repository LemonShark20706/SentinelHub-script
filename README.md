# This script helps with getting satellite pictures from coordinates and a date.

It provides a simple script to fetch pictures from Sentinel Hub's API.


## Description

This script allows users to give in a boundary box and a date range to fetch satellite images from Sentinel Hub's API. The script handles the API requests, processes the responses, and saves the images to a specified directory. It also includes error handling to manage potential issues during the API calls. The script gives back a .TIFF file with the satellite image for the specified location and date range. The user can specify the desired resolution and the type of satellite data (e.g., Sentinel-2) to retrieve the relevant images and can also shoose the bands they want to include in the output image.
